Just a sample implementation of a simple web server written in Go with Gorilla mux package

-> Includes three entities in DB to demonstrate relationship concept  (Similar to Google Classroom but not so detailed :) )


-> Illustration with JWT for authentication

-> Bootstraped the server with Air package for quick reloading on saving changes 

-> Validated all incoming requests using middlewares and input validation using Go-Validator

-> Planning to add few more endpoints ,building a docker image for this and refactoring existing code will try out sooon !

-> Don't forget to check .env.sample file for the format of environment variables 


-> Postman collection for endpoints https://www.postman.com/collections/4370698b21d42f0e410b

P.s Ignore the fmt.Println("") statements !
